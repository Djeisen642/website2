        Oh... Introductions? Umm... Hi! My name is Jason Suttles. I currently work at Medicom
        Technologies building healthcare software transferring medical images and facilitating
        automated solutions. I work on frontend work and backend work. We do some cool things with
        websockets and AWS cloud infrastructure. Microservices. CDK. CI/CD pipelines. (I've touched
        it all.) Mostly, I'm a JavaScript/TypeScript developer. I'd say I've got a very good handle
        on what is possible in the JavaScript world. &lt;Awkward silence&gt; What's that? You don't
        like how this website looks? Hmm... well, I can't say that I've got a good eye for how to
        make things look nice.
        <em>But, if you can design it, I can build it.</em> Take a look at the games. I didn't
        design them, but I definitely developed them.
      </p>
      <p class="text-body mb-4">
        In my free time, I enjoy travelling, hiking, doing new things, eating new foods, playing
        sports casually, playing video games casually, and playing board games viciously. If I had
        an infinite budget, I'd spend my time working on modern, interesting, and worthwhile
        software projects with knowledgeable and fun people, peppering my time with family, friends,
        and travel. I like being useful and competent.
      </p>
      <p class="text-body mb-4">
        Did I mention I have a philosophy degree along with my comp. sci. degree and math minor?
      </p>
      <p class="text-body">
        Well... that's enough about me. Feel free to browse around and/or get back to whatever you
        were doing before. I do recommend coming back every once in a while, though. This website
        might surprise you with something useful.
