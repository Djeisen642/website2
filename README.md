## Notes:

- uses Nuxt 3, Vue 3, Vuetify to build the frontend framework
- uses Google Firebase for realtime store, hosting, metrics, authentication (just for admin)
- uses vue-axe to check for accessibility
- uses commitlint to ensure commit messages follow a standard
- uses GitHub Actions to lint, SAST, build, and publish to Google Firebase
- No tests... ðŸ˜…
- @nuxtjs/robots is not working for some reason

## Reminders:

- Adding the Content-Security-Policy is a non-trivial process
